            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>From the beginning, websites have always been about displaying content. This is the underlying purpose behind every site on the Internet, or at least it should be. In order to determine which content or functionality you should put on the site, it is critical to determine the purpose or goals of the site. The content should support that purpose. At a high level these purposes can take many forms:

                Build Revenue : Build revenues for your new/existing business or
                Share Information : Share corporate or educational information or
                Share Opinions : Share opinions on a subject
                Share Personal Interests : Share personal interests with family and friends
                All websites should have a purpose, and that purpose should be more than 'My teacher is making me do this'. The purpose needs to be defined by the client and stakeholders and not the site developer. For the course rafting project, you will need to imagine that you are the owner of the rafting business and have decided that it is time for you to have an online presence.</p>
